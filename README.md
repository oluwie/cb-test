# Testing Exercise
This is a set of samples I'm using to attempt to get a good working grasp of a coding exercise I'm taking for employment.


The interview subject concerns optimization of an existing workflow pertaining to a REST API.  
If you bring your own equipment, here's what you'll need to be able to do:  
  ☐ Receive an API request over HTTP.  
  ☐ Parse the request and assemble an appropriate response.  
  ☐ Be able to manipulate and parse JSON string data.  
  ☐ Be prepared to write and execute tests for the code you write.  
Finally, your laptop has to be able to connect to a wired Ethernet network and output display to our projector (DisplayPort, HDMI, or VGA).  
We'll provide the cables.

You can prepare your IDE in advance, including loading any software frameworks or other such dependencies and setting up a project skeleton with these things pre-configured. (We're interested in understanding your approach to problem-solving and the quality of your implementation, and that doesn't include watching you set up Django or Spring, but if you have any concerns about using something, just ask).
